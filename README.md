# INTRO

This is a task done for House of Code.

The task asks for the use of:
C# / .NET
Angular
Bootstrap
CSS/HTML

I don't know C# / .NET and Angular and found it a bit much to learn a new scripting languish in 1 week, but I decided to do the task using PHP instead.
I do use Bootstrap for the layout and grid systems.

If given more time, I would love to try and learn C# / .NET and Angular.

This task shows:
A landingpage.
A signup page.
A signin page.
A forgot password page.
A CMS to change products on landing page.
Ability to logout.
Error messages on wrong or missing form inputs.


# Important INFO

This project was set up on a WAMP server.
This means the "dbconnect" file in the "includes" folder connects to a localhost.
Username is set to "root" and no password, and the database is called hoc.

In the folder sql there are 2 sql files. One containing user info and one with the info for the products on the landing page.

If sql files are imported and the db connect file is pointing to the correct database.
You can login with one of these 2 users, or create your own (if you make your own it will not have the admin page).

Normal user logon:
email: user@user.com
password: user

Admin logon:
email: admin@admin.com
password: admin
